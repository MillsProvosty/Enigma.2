Line a cutting board with parchment paper. Unfold puff pastry onto cutting board. Cut each sheet into 4 equal squares.
Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Grease with cooking spray.
Place one puff pastry square in the preheated waffle iron; cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining puff pastry squares.
Cook's Note:
Nonstick waffle irons may not need to be sprayed with cooking spray.
