Self Assessment for Enigma Project:

Functionality: 3
Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented. Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces successfully implemented.
Everything is there!

Object Oriented Programming: Either a 3....or a 1
Project is broken into logical components consisting of at least 4 classes that have single responsibilities. Variable and method names always clearly communicate purpose.

Technically none of my tests are longer than 7 lines. However, I used the ; to merge lines, so I'm not sure if that's allowed ðŸ˜‚. Honestly, my code isn't tight enough to make it any shorter. So, I completely understand if it's a 1.

Test Driven Development: 3.5
All test names clearly communicate the purpose of the test. Test coverage metrics show 100% coverage. No use of mocks or stubs.

Version Control: 3.5
Over 40 commits and 15 pull requests that are named and documented to clearly communicate the purpose of the pull request. No more than 3 commits include multiple pieces of functionality.
